In this project, I took the template html and css for the Horiseon website and refactored it to improve user accessibility. I started by including semantic tags on significant HTML elements, as well as making sure the structure of the HTML code was orderly (there were h3 tags listed above h2 tags) The CSS code was also able to be condensed by creating new class names for elements that had alike style alterations and then creating a single CSS command using this class name. This was able to reduce CSS redundancies significantly. Additional chnages included creating alt descriptions for visual elements, fixing a snapdown function, and getting rid of unneeded div tags.
